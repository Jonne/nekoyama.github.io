How sweet is to find a soundtrack for your feelings. This morning walking in the downtown of Rennes at 'Republique' station I heard a whisper, not for me... But I didn't care and I steal it.
The lyrics of this beautiful song by <a title="read more about Bebe" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bebe?setlang=en">Bebe </a>a Spanish singer makes me think that my language is the most beautiful. Althought my interpretation is not the real, the feeling that stays it's a strong nostalgia of an obsession that took your head and killed a part of you and when you remember what happened your body reproduces how it felt.
Bref. It's a sensual  lullaby.
