<a href="http://hectorpadilla.wordpress.com/">Hector </a>and Albane are going to SFMOMA this week,  I remember when I went there. I have some ideas of Modern Art and are bad, but sometimes a master piece makes me regret some words that I've said about it.

I've been doing a lot of things lately... Taking care of my dearest and trying to keep my head clear. Life is Amazing! And now I had a thought about Yoko Ono, she knew it! Life is a wonderful chance, so then she create <a href="http://www.arttowermito.or.jp/art/yokoono.html">it</a>. She's one of the cool examples of young people who knows what to do with their money and life at the right time. I would like be like her.

Peace.
