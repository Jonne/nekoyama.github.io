WOW! I've found something amazing! A beloved gave me this chance and these things happens for something. I had to cross the ocean to meet this instrument! This makes me think of future, like a thing from another time, another planet and yes why not from a secret civilisation.

This is my instrument and curiously in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes">Rennes </a>there's a guy that went to Switzertland and got his own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(musical_instrument)">Hang</a>! Now I'm the next!! XD
