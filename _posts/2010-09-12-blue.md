<strong>PANEL 1.
</strong><span style="color:#f20c3f;">I'm laying in a darky, dirty and cold room. Awakening by the light that comes from a window that is not displayed yet.</span>

<strong>Dialog box.</strong> Dreaming I woke up in a cold room, I was on the floor. I was wearing a shirt and panties, I was cold and dizzy.

<strong>PANEL 2.
</strong><span style="color:#f20c3f;">My face is in first plane</span>

<strong>Dialog box.</strong> Then, I saw the light that came trough the window and with it the whisper of a beautiful song. Suddenly I felt so hot and it seemed that that light called me... I took off my shirt and I walked straight to the window.

<span style="color:#f20c3f;">In all the panels the song playing... </span>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Never seen a blue sky
Yeah I can feel it reaching out
And moving closer
There's something about blue</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Asked myself what it's all for
You know the funny thing about it
I couldn't answer
No I couldn't answer"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>PANEL 3.
Dialog box. </strong>I listened the song and I felt that it called me. I got lost into the light like if I was diving into the ocean. I never felt like that, I wanted to cry because I was happy even knowing that it may be the last time I saw the light.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>PANEL 4.
Dialog box. </strong>Yes, I was diving into an ocean of light.</p>

<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;line-height:normal;font-size:12px;"> </span>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Things have turned a deeper shade of blue
And images that might be real
May be illusion
Keep flashing off and on</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Free
Wanna be free
Gonna be free</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And move among the stars
You know they really aren't so far</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Feels so free
Gotta know free
Please"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Dialog box.</strong> My love dived too, he was looking into my eyes and he was touching me so sweetly. But then I asked myself if that feeling was real, so my love faded away. I felt so sad that I needed an answer. The song continued even if I didn't want to listen it anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://nekoyamaharuko.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/descarga-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" title="sad" alt="" src="http://nekoyamaharuko.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/descarga-2.png" width="470" height="322" /></a></p>
<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;line-height:normal;font-size:12px;"> </span>
<p style="text-align:center;">"Don't wake me from the dream
It's really everything it seemed
I'm so free</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">

No black and white in the blue
<p style="text-align:center;">Everything is clearer now
Life is just a dream you know
That's never ending
I'm ascending"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Dialog box.</strong> Then, I realized that it was real. I didn't want to wake up from. But I had heard that song before... that dream became a memory, everything in my head was there to help me find my love again.</p>
