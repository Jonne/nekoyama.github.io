I've been working so hard trying to get a good level of french that life is becoming crazy!! This feeling of frustation is getting bigger inside of me that I just have no idea of what I want or what it's next.
This is my first time in Europe and France is an extraordinary mix of culture. LOVE it! Buuuuut you are another person. A day you wake up and you find yourself submerged in a life with people that you met few months ago that became your close friends and you have new questions and paradoxes. Then you look yourself at the mirrow and there're are the questions, hunting every strinkle, your new hair cut and your brand new facial soap.

I asked my close friends, my best friends, the old ones: hey who am I? Could you describe me? And then I ask myself how I couldnt know who I am?! Of course they haven't the answers for such stupidquestions.
And here they are! My DevinatART and my favourite artists! I love these ilustrations from <a href="http://wakkawa.deviantart.com/">*wakkawa</a> .<a href="http://wakkawa.deviantart.com/">
</a>But I am not so gothic, not so emo, I am like a dark butterfly, I love to dream, I love to be alone and read, draw or write... but knowing that I am for someone "the only one". I love to be there and then scape from myself, like a litle uracane of despire and passion. Yes, like that. Could be simple but it isn't. "C'est pas moi".<a href="http://wakkawa.deviantart.com/">

Note: <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gothicness">gothicness</a> Used to describe how gothic one is. Can also be used to describe the aura of Goth, much like 'The Force'. &lt;&lt;I am at one with my ultimate Gothicness. I can use the Gothicness around me to make others depressed.&gt;&gt;
