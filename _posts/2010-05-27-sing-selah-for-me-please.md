<div>I remember the day when my best friend told me that maybe I should have a boyfriend who can paint something or sing for me... A pasionated guy. But maybe for me there's not a painting or a song. Maybe there's so much love.</div>
<div>How it feels to be the object of inspiration of someone? Hummpf**</div>
