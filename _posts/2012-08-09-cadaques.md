In a manner of a quick disclaimer: I want to dedicate this first paragraph to tell you about the new approach that I want to give to this blog, I hope that this attempt do not discourage you to continue reading this post which I consider the beginning of what you may consider "the after" of my blogging career. I will write mostly about ART (the plastic work, the places, the people and feelings that caught my attention). Hope you will enjoy it.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to visit the hometown of a friend Xavi. Cadaqués is an old fisherman's town that among all the villages of the Costa Brava is the only one that preserved his peculiar atmosphere, escaping to the construction craziness that in the last decade modified the landscape almost everywhere in Spain. I’m convinced that it was possible thanks to the Natural reserve that surrounds it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_de_Creus">Cap de Creus Natural Park</a>) and because of his Art Scene. Many artists visited the town leaving behind them a rising reputation so the town became appealing to other artist and tourists. The list of artist that visited the town is huge; Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Andre Breton, Salvador Dalí and many others.  Salvador Dalí marked the town; he built a house at Port Lligat so he used to be a local personality. Walking around the other night we found a café where there’s a guitar player that used to be a Dalí’s friend, I knew it because a piece of paper on the window, old print of a picture of a guy playing the guitar and Dalí besides him listening (or posing for the picture), I found that piece of paper a bit cheesy and then my friend said “He’s the owner of the place, so he can play the guitar every fucking night“. I loved to be there with a local guy, this town offers you a postal card in every corner and is pure inspiration, but being in a place as a tourist is one thing, still special, but is not so fortunate… This time I was invited to discover a place from the perspective of the locals and as far I can tell, it is very fortunate!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I visited the art gallery “Galería Cadaqués“ few nights ago because my friend Xavi is working there so I had the chance to meet <a href="http://www.artnet.com/ag/fulltextsearch.asp?searchstring=huc%20malla">Huc Malla</a>, Bombelli’s close friend, who reopened the gallery in 2003. We had a nice chat about the current exposition and a little about how he became the owner of the gallery. The gallery is in the downtown of Cadaqués and is one of the best Art Galleries of Spain, it was created in 1973 by the architect Lafranco Bombelli with the goal of expose the last trends in the Contemporary Art, the gallery became popular rapidly and reached the highest circles of the Art Scene with artists that exposed for the very first time in Spain, Dieter Roth, Marcel Duchamp, David Hockney, Joseph Beuys, Richard Hamilton and many others. Huc Malla is faithful to his friend and a real Art lover, I am very happy that I met him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"Minderwertig gemälde" is the name of the current exposition with art works of <a href="http://www.jakeanddinoschapman.com/">Jake and Dinos Chapman</a>, <a href="http://nelsondiplexcito.com/">Nelson Diplexcito</a>, Marcus Harvey and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I really like John Stark, the experience with his painting went far when I remembered the insect that stole a piece of ham from my sandwich. I came by car to Cadaqués with friends, so we made a stop to eat something, I was sitting in the middle of some trees and a bee probably a "Yellow Jacket" (or it was a wasp that looked like a bee) passed by, the second time he stopped over the ham that was heading out of the bread and chopped a tiny piece with his mandible... I have never seen something like that. It was an unexpected vision, a bee interested in a piece of ham.</p>
