Greetings my dear readers, I'd like to introduce you to my best girl friends Dagmar and Gisela (L-R order). We celebrated Dagmar's birthday at "Wing's Army" (more pictures coming soon... --Dagmar I'm still waiting  &gt;_&lt;' --). We met at IBM four years ago and since then we have been working on our world domination project, HUA HUA! We have a lot of things in common, we like anime, art, skydiving, snowboarding, Canada, comics, fantasy, cosplay, Japan, we are IT professionals, we want to live in another country and we are such exotic beauties!

Friendship is a priceless gift. Finally I have friends to share my life with. They may go or they may stay by my side, who knows! But it doesn't matter if they get a scholarship in another Country or if they get married and move to another city.  :D  I will be there for them.

I'm daydreaming about my birthday this September. The party will be in Mantova or in Venice!!! My best friends must to be there too. So, wait for updates.  :D
