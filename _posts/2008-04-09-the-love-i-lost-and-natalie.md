How to call "The Muse" and write about something that ended with such suffering? When you know that will hurt and then face it. I can say in my defense that I am not "falling out with love" and yes I am a terrible lover, the lover who loves deeply without thinking about consequences, just floating with the Tao, full of joy giving everything and also letting it be... How to be a good lover with 25 years old and a lot of things started? There is no answer for me and I discovered it recently, but I think that the next time I will be a good lover. These things that make you cry are the sour and inspiration to write songs, poems, paint to remember, live lots of crazy episodes and write in blogs. :P

Everybody going to feel pain with a broken heart, the question mark here is "the attitude" and I am choosing the MUSIC.
<!--more-->The song for this episode will be "Believe Me Nathalie" from <a title="The Killers" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers" target="_blank">The Killers</a>. The intro gives you the perfect scenario for something important that is about to be told, the drums drives you desperately in a memory, the memory where you had to make a decision about moving forward and leave a place, stop believing in something that will never happen and trust in yourself and dance! And a prayer for the last chance. The last chance that was taken and I got my heart broken -- "Adieu"-- deeply inside in my heart and then forgotten.

<div style="text-align:left;">My face changed since that day and I am trying to fix it, I think that I look beautiful in that picture. What do you think?</div>
<div style="text-align:left;">The next step... One more song, for forgiveness:</div>

<div style="text-align:left;">I got a lesson of <a title="The Arcade Fire" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Arcade+Fire/_/My+Heart+Is+an+Apple" target="_blank">love</a>, about to make decisions on time and never regret yourself about something that went wrong, but you got to learn and enjoy. At the end, this is part of my dreamily life. I found that maybe Coldplay is one of my favourites and I cry always when I listen <a title="Coldplay" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/_/In+My+Place+%28New+Album+Version%29">In My Place</a>, Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil are closely related, Borges changed my philosophy, Facebook sucks and funny movies are not too bad.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Dear friends, thank you for your support, thank you for all those chats, your hugs, for all that red wine... Thanks for <a title="Stay out of trouble" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kings+of+Convenience/_/Stay+Out+of+Trouble">this song </a>that you will surely listen in a coffee shop or in a bar, I'll let you know when CAT HAT will be playing.
<strong>Sunnier. </strong>So Natalie... Would you come along with me and find a go-go?</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"><strong>Natalie.</strong> Dear! I'll take you with me.</div>
