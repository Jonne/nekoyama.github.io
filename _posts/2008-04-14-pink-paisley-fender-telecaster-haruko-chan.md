<p style="text-align:left;">Greetings my dear readers. Do you like rock? Do you sing your favorite songs in the car, house, office or in a party? Have you ever dream to play a professional guitar? Yeah, like you favorite rock star. I DO!<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I like to sing anytime and everywhere, I tried to learn music few years ago and also I had been in 2 or 3 amateur bands,  but never as the one I joined recently "HE SHOT ME" remember this name cause you will hear more about it! XD And with this band my dream came true, I played an amazing, pink and beautiful guitar... The Fender Pink Paisley!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ely Guerra used to play with the Fender Paisley in her presentations, Elvis, Ricky Nelson, Merle Haggard and James Burton also played this guitar and now the next in the list is <strong>Hilda Segur</strong>!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I was jamming! It was one of the best moments of my life. It was my first try so I apologize for the quality of the sound, video, interpretation, &lt;fill the blank&gt;.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Segur.</strong> Hey that guitar is pink! Woa...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>C.J. </strong>Yes, it's your guitar...</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Segur.</strong> Woot? &lt;Stunned&gt;.</p>
