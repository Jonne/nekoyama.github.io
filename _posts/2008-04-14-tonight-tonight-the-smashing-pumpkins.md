Hey! Finally I found time to tell you what about the Corgan's concert. He is an artist, beautiful and talented. He wore a silver long skirt, I thought I was listening a prince of a space legion. He started playing the best known songs like 'Mayonnaise', 'Perfect' and 'Tonight' then we broke in to 20 minutes of feedback and a solo guitar, wow! But the best moment was when "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" cover started, we just couldn't believe it! Such a experienced musician as Billy Corgan can play a Pink Floy's cover and delight all the hungry hearts...  <!--more-->

I felt the drums in my chest and all the people was quiet, just listening, they didn't knew the lyrics or whatever... But lucky me! I could fully enjoy the song with my eyes closed. You know, I hate to listen the voice of a tone deaf in a concert! That is something we have to change in Mexico, guys you sing horrible! Let the artists do their jobs, we paid for it! Only if they ask the public to participate in the song, ok I understand it and I would participate too, but if they didn't ask please don't interfere!!  &gt;_&lt;

I rather think that I am a grinch or maybe this attitude is because my age, I am getting older, oh dear!
