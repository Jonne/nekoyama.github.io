I met a french guy 4 months ago, he amazed me with his blue eyes, his way of thinking and many other things! I didn't recognize the feeling before, but I used to love to talk with him in French, sometimes in Spanish or just stay with him and drink, draw something. We love to be together and that was obviously something special that we didn't hide.
I am so visual you know? I like to watch beautiful things, portraits, drawings, movies, the sky, the sea... And I've found that he is one of the most beautiful visions that I'd ever had, wake up and find his eyes and smile. It seems like Ely Guerra wrote "Ojos claros, labios rosas" for a guy like my Vincent.

I was so blue when I met him that he shared with me a song in french that I didn't understand but he explained me the lyrics... Now it's so clear! The song is <a title="Serre-moi" href="http://www.deezer.com/track/566036">"Serre-moi" by Tryo</a>. When I listened it again in December (few weeks ago) I knew that I had to turn off the page of my life.
