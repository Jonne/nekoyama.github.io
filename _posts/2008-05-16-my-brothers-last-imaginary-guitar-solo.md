<span>"Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet, everything happens a certain number of times and very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it. Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty? And yet it all seems so limitless".  By CJ.</span>
