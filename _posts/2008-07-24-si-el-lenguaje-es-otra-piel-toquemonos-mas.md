This is my first week being a Freescale's released babe and it's kinda confusing for. Reprogram myself will take, I think, few more days. It's late and I deactivated my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> account because I don't have time and I thought I should instead work more on my thesis or write. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook </a>is addictive. It even has a survey where ironically there's an option that described my situation perfectly (so I clicked on the radio button). As soon as I get more time and new stuff to share with friends at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook </a>like new pics of Rennes :-P I will reactivate it.

In order to get my french VISA I've been working on "Mon Dossier", lots of documents! Last Sunday I killed the GOLEM, I am again the Gothic Drama Queen (Trinity?)... Here is the first photo of my new and very original look.

But in my passport I will keep for the next 10 years the photo of the Russian spy.  Gosh!
