A few minutes ago I had a call with my best friend Dave, he is now in his parent's house in a small city near the Pacific Ocean and 8 hours from here; about to leave and join Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. I will miss him more than ever, but life is so interesting and intense lately, I can imagine ourselves snowboarding this December and traveling to Japan in 2009, drinking coffee in a beautiful city, raining and the gray sky making me sigh...

<!--more--> I remember when I met him, I was in the bus stop near my apartment in "EcaDo Queiros" street and I saw him waiting, we worked for IBM at that time (December 2004) and used take the same corporative bus of the technology campus that was outside the city. I made the 'peace &amp; love' signal with my right hand and I said 'Hi!', he smiled and we started to talk about, you know, the same stuff as everybody when you meet someone, Where do you live? How old are you? What are you doing at IBM? Where you studied? and then the Hilda's first meet related questions,  Where do you come from? Are you from Mexico? and obviously following my answers; the Hilda's first meet related comments, really?, you have a different ascent,  you look different, then did you lived somewhere outside Mexico? Of course wasn't the first and either the last time someone asked me and made such questions and comments about myself, but what made special the encounter was his comment "I think you are a funny woman".    O_O
We started to meet everyday in the bus and our conversations use to be so funny and noisy! Ha ha... We really enjoyed to talk and drink coffee, chat everyday, walk our way back to home after work and one day he moved to the same building and lived around two months there, then we decided to move together and became roommates. Why? We were so alike that was a good idea and we wanted to save money, at the end we didn't but it was funny. Yeah I wanted to live in a place where I could have my beloved "Primogenito" my fat stripped cat, but I will save that story for another post.

In the new apartment we raised 9 cats in a year, bought a car, fight a lot, lost a housekeeper and one day I decided to move with my Japanese teacher (Takafuji-sensei) in order to improve my Japanese quickly and also I joined Freescale Semiconductor MX, so Dave cried and then we didn't see eachother in a month, was hard. Then we went to the "Yeah Yeah Yeas" concert at the Diana's theater, I will never forget that night was great! It was our first concert and we drank a lot of beer at the "RED Pub", Dave likes Germany, German and beer. I left Takafuji's house and moved to a new apartment with a Japanese girlfriend  "Yuko-san" and then Dave joined me when she came back to Japan. We were roommates again in a new apartment chic, minimalist, with a beautiful kitchen and with a very nice entrance, near our big withe bridge, I will never forget that beautiful image, I shall paint that place one day. We really loved our last apartment, I think it was there we had our best moments, Dave saw me cry as I never cried in my life, we used to go to the gym, listen music, watch movies; my office was in the same way to his office so we use to had super breakfasts, coffee and conversations before work. But at the end of the fantastic 2007 we had to leave that place, because after a thousand times I told him "leave Mexico, join Microsoft" he is about to be hired and finally leave me.

I  am reading "Ignorance" by Milan Kundera, we bought the book the last day we spent together.
He finally left two weeks ago to meet his parents and spend time with them before travel to Redmond. See your Space Cowboy.
