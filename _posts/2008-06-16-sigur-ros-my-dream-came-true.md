I wanted to share this concert with a special person but unfortunately I was lonely. Who doesn't want to share a dream with a lover? I found friends but I decided just to get lost in the public and cry a lot, I am a Drama Queen.

I recorded a single video and few pictures. I just couldn't waste time doing that and I stopped cause I was crying. But what I got is beautiful.

I love music...  Awn!  ^_^

I will never forget it.
