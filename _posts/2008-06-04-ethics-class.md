<p style="text-align:justify;">I had Ethics class yesterday night. I found it inspiring and specially useful. According to my professor there are 7 rules for living in society, with human relations being the most important aspect we need to care about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I found myself confronted during the lesson. I began to realize that my way of thinking ran contrary to what was being taught in the class in many ways, especially with regards to the first rule: "Do not criticize, do not blame, do not complain". I don't want to mention the other rules for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at my own posts I started to notice how oftenly I complain and make shallow judgements about other people and their situations… I suddenly felt embarrassed about myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I don't want to break the human relation I have with others and I think there are virtues that can be practiced instead of complaining.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We live in a world of inmense beauty, and I think that wasting time complaining only leads to gradually losing the ability to marvel at its beauty and magnificence.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I have decided to practice focusing in the details. Tell sincerely the good things I think about people and try to be positive about things that I can not change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people seek to become better persons by programming themselves according to some set of rules and guidelines, such as religion…
But I think that all that we need is common sense, science and very good ideas, good feelings, love…
Interest for life and to live enjoying what one can get every single moment. Perhaps that's the human virtue "Wisdom".</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've been practicing something else that could be useful, I try to avoid negative information such as violence, bloody stuff in the streets,
TV and instead I give to myself beauty, music, art, good company and a good espresso… You may think this is old fashioned or not particularly intelligent, but you can try and see how it works for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I want to share with you this music video of <a title="C'est extra" href="http://www.last.fm/music/L%C3%A9o+Ferr%C3%A9/_/C%27est+Extra" target="_blank">Léo Ferré</a> because it made me feel good today.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The beauty in the lyrics and the music, just here in my apartment, I need a glass of water. Bonne nuit.</p>
