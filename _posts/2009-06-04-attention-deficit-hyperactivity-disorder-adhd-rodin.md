In order to study at one of <a href="http://www.beauxarts-bretagne.asso.fr/index.php">the universities of Art in Brittany</a> I had an experience of 2 days. The first day I had my drawing, observation and culture tests. The second day I had my French language test (ah yes? If I really need to do it! Damn...) and the afternoon I had several meetings with each university. That was an experience very interesting, I've never had that kind of feedback about myself (my personality), my expectations, my influences (japanese "Manga", yes right...) and my passion.

Well at the end I was "admise" in 3 of 4!   :)  I'm so happy! I would like to go to <a href="http://www.esa-brest.fr/">Brest</a> just the first year. It is front of the beach and there are amazing places to get inspiration, surf, walk and think in front the sea! <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/26-04-2005-015.jpg">Take a look</a>.

Well, I just want to share some of the work I did during my tests. I had to draw something based in those two images regarding to a topic that I had to choose.

"The fantasy is the aparition: something that can not happen but it happens, in the exact moment in a perfect universe naively measured so the mystery will not dissapear ".<!--more-->

In front of me it was a shiny "red-coke", I was thirsty and I needed some sugar, that was the real-objet so I placed it in that classroom that it was "my reallity" at that moment and it became my scenario for the "aparition(s)" about those things that couldn't happen in that reallity "30 in a classroom drawing" I erased everyone and the teacher, all tables, chairs... etc. Then, I placed myself there, an armchair, the coke and the window. The action? I wasn't drinking, when in my reality I want it and I was in a total crisis that was something imposible (status ZEN) and the another "RED" object was the connection between my reallity and the reallity-scenario, because the armchair wasn't a real-object but it became something real and not an image in the reallity-scenario but it became twice an image in my reallity!

I don't really know, but if I wanted to show you an aparition by my ilustration, I've failed. I meant you need the reference of my reallity at that moment to understand. I think that maybe the teachers (my jury) didn't understood what I wanted to express but they liked the idea at the end.

It doesn't matter what you want to express and what you do to express it, it's really hard to make the others get it right away!!!

I remember when I went to <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">SF MOMA</a> and I was so disappointed cause I found that I needed an explanation for each piece of art, sculpture, etc... And I thought -I'm stupid, I don't understand Modern Art... sorry Warhol-, but there were all the explanations and justifications from their creators!!! Even worst, Modern Art is so relative that all the spectators are stupid and they need and explanation and their creators need to justify themselves. Or this "Modern Art" could be just a caprice, a desire selfish in order to escape from reality or modify it just for a moment, the moment that existed only in the life of the creator. This is not "Art Performance" cause the spectators exist and share the moment of creation with the artist, so I think that Modern Art could lose some of credibility in his capacity of communicating something in the name of experimentation, cause at the end we need to read an explanation in a fucking piece of paper! So that's why.
