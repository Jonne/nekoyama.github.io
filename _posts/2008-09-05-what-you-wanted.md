Randomly I've found these videos in my favorites... I've studied tonight and I wanted to relax.

I know that being so far away in the same latitude as Quebec in an amazingly petite et belle ville with the gray and cold days that I love, bring beautiful and sad memories staying in your room instead of out with your new class mates and drink cidre and eat crepes AGAIN! could be weird, but hey I am such a romantic and passionated girl (Drama Queen)... And yeah I've caught a terrible cold HA! XD<!--more-->

The illumination of the videos curiously is mostly the same... That beautiful gray like this sky in Rennes, France.

The simplicity of the music and the sincerity of the lyrics makes me dream about the day in a concert or in the car, HE will answer with a passionated kiss. Surely without asking nothing.

Well this song is in French and I listened it long long time ago when I even thought of learn French or live in France!

Win Wenders is one of my favorite film directors and I think that one reason because I admire him is his story that touched other artists like U2 and moved them to create a beautiful song for the love of some buddy that can't be close the beloved, not because there's no love NO! there's the most beautiful and passionated love but it can't be because the destiny, the logic, the natural order of things... Hell!!!

I will post soon my impressions about this place, the people, the food, my university... Maybe in French too.
