<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I used to write science fiction few years ago, why? From where came that wish of became a super outcast of 14 years old? My problem started when I dreamed "the dream", being someone different and change my life and turn it all in to that dream, sounds obvious uh? In the meantime of a big break out in my life when I was 18 years old, I met my friends “the Labyrinths" members of a selected group called “The labyrinth” hi hi ^^  (</span></span><span><span lang="FR"><a href="http://elcuervolopez.blogspot.com/2008/06/sobre-tolkien-y-el-seor-de-los-anillos.html"><span lang="EN-US">Laura Michel</span></a></span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> <a href="http://masklin8.deviantart.com/">Tonatiuh Moreno</a>,</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span lang="FR"><a href="http://capitanquasar.blogspot.com/"><span lang="EN-US">Grabriel Benitez</span></a></span></span><span><span>... Lovers of Literature, Tolkien, Arthur C. Clark, Miyasaki, Dungeons &amp; Dragons,etc.), t</span>hat group born in the middle of a Master in Communications thesis project of two members, students of the University <a href="http://portal.iteso.mx/portal/page/portal/ITESO" target="_blank">ITESO</a> and they shared the project with the community in my home town <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara,_Jalisco" target="_blank">Guadalajara</a> as part of they research. Later a book came out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Laberinto-Spanish-Am%C3%83%C2%A9zquita-Tonatiuh-Moreno/dp/9687822023">“Laberinto”</a>. Well, the research and a secular group inside, published two specialized magazines without any special success (only their friends and the mini-community of outcasts from three states <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacatecas" target="_blank">Zacatecas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco" target="_blank">Jalisco</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayarit" target="_blank">Nayarit</a> used to bought those issues, I still have 2 or 3 hidden somewhere) <span> </span>and lots of friends to play ROL games! But the writers stayed together just at the end, to have religious meetings every weekend to play ROL games, write, read with a cat in your feet and interchange opinions of personal literature projects. <!--more--><span><span><span>
So then, I met the group, the energy and the power of destiny (my will) guided my old friends to me. I was working in a Library that was just two blocks from the dungeon (Laura’s parents house), was a beautiful Sunday, they were searching a book… And Laura saw one of my drawings and speaked to me. <span> </span></span></span><span><span lang="FR">Voilà</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span><span>But what about this story? I beleive of what Vargas Llosa said about fiction and the origins of the humanity, man had to dream first his reallity and he's not the first one of saying it. I dreamed once of become a "story teller", draw, write, live and inspire others to dream with passion their lives, cause it works! I felt that I had many things to say and share but when I met "the laberynths"  they show me the path (with the help of Orson Scott Card) and also they amazed me many times with their stories, many times I looked at them like my big bros and sis and I wanted to be like them. They used to dream with passion and touched my heart. Those are real story tellers, those that drives others into the dreamworld. 
Later I met many other "story tellers" (I meant, friends, lovers, writers, artist of all different kinds...) that gives me such punch that right now it's impossible to get out. I must to finish this journey.</span></span></span></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span><span><span>THANKS everybody to be there... I meant right here, kiss. </span></span></span></span></p>
