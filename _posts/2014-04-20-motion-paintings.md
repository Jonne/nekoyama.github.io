<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a bunch of videos about the animation work of Jacco Olivier (1972). I can imagine that you have watched at least one, but like me never seen his work closely during an exhibit. This time I was lucky by being in the right place to watch <em>"Cycle" the ever first Dutch retrospective with works from the last decade at the <a title="Fotomuseum Den Haag" href="http://www.fotomuseumdenhaag.com/en" target="_blank">Fotomuseum</a> in Den Haag.

It was a very nice experience because his animations are projected in real size and that matters. Watching the colors moving and the textures being projected all over the rooms, gives to his work lots of life and you can stop staring at them. Every projection is a motion story and you are obliged to stop and wait till the narrative circle closes. You will never know at what time of the story you will walk into a room.

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of my favorites: a small canvas projected on the wall at almost 2,5 meters from the floor to give you the impression of watching two birds flying free in the air.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jacco Olivier graduated from the Kunstacademie in Den Bosch in 1996 and from the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam in 1998. His career took off immediately afterwards, when his work was spotted by Victoria Miro Gallery in London and soon after by Marianne Boesky in New York. In The Netherlands he is represented by the <a title="Gallery Ron Mandos" href="http://www.ronmandos.nl/">Gallery Ron Mandos</a> in Rotterdam, my next visit.</p>
