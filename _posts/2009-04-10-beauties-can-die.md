<p style="text-align:left;"><span><strong>G</strong></span><span>oddess and woman. Once, a metal blonde depressive girl and now a romantic brunette.</span></p>

<span> I guess that there's some kind of girl... Like me, that needs to solve some kind of paradigm deep inside. Our God it's our Demon. Many times our biggest, darkest, strongest enemy lives in ourselves and we must fight him, trying to call him by his real name, so then we will be free. There are many stories, poems, paintings, movies, etc., about this. We are alchemists. Its funny how in this video of one of my favorite Mexican singers, you can watch the brunette killing the blonde, Ely probably knows something about this mythology because in her biography you'll find a battle between the model and the outcast musician. There are some other Alchemist, Druids, and Prophets... Wise people who help you, they know your real name, love you and stay by your side. There are many others, kind of wise who can call you by your real name, but they use it against you.<!--[if gte vml 1]&gt;                    &lt;![endif]--><!--more--></span>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span>I don't know if you get the idea, but for some of us, because we are complicated, finding our real self it's a passionate journey maybe dramatic, cause we need to kill... it's our life, this could be interesting but you must to be strong. Maybe I will learn nothing but I believe in myself, in my brown eyes in my voice, friends and hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span>I apologize for being such a "Space Bounty Hunter", knowledge most of the time gives you pain, sometimes it gives you truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span>And in the language of symbols &lt;&lt; Bleu, M83, Borges, </span><span lang="FR">Coteau</span><span> Twins and a "Re</span><span>♯</span><span>m"&gt;&gt; are stories to tell. </span></p>
