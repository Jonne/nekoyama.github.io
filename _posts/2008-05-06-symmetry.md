O_ô What? A full week without content in my last post? Why didn't you tell me or yell at me? Did you miss me?

Seems that I had problems posting what I think about <a title="Mew at last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mew" target="_self">'Mew'</a>, the indie rock band from Denmark that got the best name for a band ever! But what I am going to do is to tell you what happened these last three weeks.
I posted a YouTube video here in order to share with you which song by 'Mew' hypnotized me beyond the cool name, they got my attention because their dreamy lyrics. Take a look at the video <a title="Sing to me!!!! Please" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=i6T0bN8g6xs&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">'She Came Home For Christmas'</a>, I love it. Will you sing for me a beautiful song? Please come back and sing to me.<!--more-->

I've been getting a lot of stress from everywhere, I wasn't able to write about myself which is a very good exercise to ease my soul. But I've been working hard on new cool stuff.

I joined "Axcan Kema" a band of progressive metal, yeah! I am the beautiful fake blond vocalist. Yesterday I practiced with Héctor few songs, I like them! I met Héctor (the band lead) because we work in the same company. :P I am lucky, I found an eclectic group.

Jimy (bass), Nachito (drums), ME (vocals), Mizael (lead guitar and vocals) &amp; Hector (guitar and vocals). I had two concerts with the same group of guys in the other band of covers called 'Elemento', with that band I sang in two concerts, two weeks ago in a bar called 'Doberman' and this last Saturday in a bar called 'Cliché', both are in two small towns near the city.

We got a good feedback from the public also got several fans, :D but I think that I still have a lot of work to do with my voice and we need to buy a lot of equipment for the band. Keep reading because I will post more news about this project soon.

I got a mid time job at <a title="RGM" href="http://www.rgmmodelos.com" target="_blank">RGM</a> a modeling agency. I had an event for L'oreal and I enjoyed the experience. I met a lot of girls, we had long conversations, I liked to hear different opinions about being a model and work, study, deal with family, friends, others... I understood that anybody can trust you more that yourself.

The last Thursday I had a photo shooting session and I am working in my book, I will post few pictures from my portfolio later this month, busy days uh? I got a short hair cut and a blond hair, lot of changes! Am I still Hilda? Gosh. &gt;_&lt;
<p style="text-align:left;">I am in the office right now. I've finished all my tasks for today and I decided to stay and write, it's raining and I miss the good times with my best friend Dave. Stay in the kitchen after the dinner, drink a chai, enjoying the rain, had a conversation about anything.</p>
