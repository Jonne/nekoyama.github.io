I was thinking about the things you choose to live and the things you want to live and you couldn't, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes you're lucky and you find your way, you get what you want and everything you dream comes true in "the right moment".  Gosh! I meant, when you get what you want when you need it and when you want it. BOTH!

When I was in México Radiohead came to France... So I could't see them! You know it's one of  "THE CONCERTS OF MY LIFE". When their latest album came out wow! I just dowloaded from the web site! Then I bought it and then I lost it, now my roomate have it here in France! Nostalgy.

I'm kinda disappointed. Don't know, the latest months I've got such lessons about time matters...
