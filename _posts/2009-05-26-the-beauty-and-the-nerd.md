This is so super!!! hi hi :P  Tatsuya Ishida always have the right answers. I was thinking about this thing of being in the right moment, the last time in your life, the first love, the man of your life, love, projects, family, friends, being a nerd, geek, maybe a freak or an outsider, black&amp;white, BLUE, traveling, memories, errors, success, money... Gosh! You know, I was so stressed that just focussed my mind into the white-matrix... In front my PC. And this Sinfest mythology thing came out: "I am EVIL&amp;cute and JESUS will love me".

Note: Some of my friends will disagreed with this post because few years ago I had the Monique's profile but... Everyone changes.

OK,  I will tell you this story:

I remember that day, the day the nerd spoke to me... <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3126">"Yes, smells like fruits!".</a>

<!--more-->

He touched my heart and everything begun to change. <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3127">I'm not an outcast inside, but I love to read devil books.</a>

But sometimes, we can not fight our natural ways and we can't fight the ways of others... <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3138">"I don't have a special reason to speak to you, but... I would like to meet you".</a>

So I started to ignore the facts and I dreamed... <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3141">Maybe it's when I went wrong.</a>

I believe that love can change the world and the order of things. <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3145">But unfortunately those things were stronger than me</a>.

Those things were out of my understanding, I spent nights, trying to understand... Try to change myself for another and not for myself, just brought me confusion! <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3146">And it wasn't his fault</a>.

My friends and family just couldn't understood. <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3154">Why a such beauty fell in love of a little cheesy nerd?</a>

Life was good, with all my demons, with all the problems... <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3155">He was someone amazing and sweet</a>.

I was acting like a little girl... <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3159">trying to become someone perfect for him</a>.

There was something that he found interesting on me. I'm a very interesting girl too, you know? <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3161">But he had some issues</a>.

For a little while we shared some lectures...<a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3162"> And I dreamed harde</a>r.

Obviously I had some projects and I use to question myself about those sweety dreams. <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3177">World domination! </a>

Then he got hurt by my destructive "love-drama tendences"...  <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/archive_page.php?comicID=3183">At the end this is a common love story</a>.

And I didn't want to hurt him either... No matter if  we have the right to tell a story in a different way, human history it's a sort of loop... It's always the same shit. This time we weren't strong enough.

<strong>But sometimes some stories are exceptions that became legends, myths or fables...  A man Strong, different and amazingly intelligent, with the power and the divine understanding, with a super protecting and caring love it's what I need!!!  Someone like JESUS. </strong>
