<p style="text-align:justify;">I've experienced <a title="Theo Jansen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Jansen">Theo Jansen</a>'s work like if I was reading a fairy tale. Hereby an abstract: "The beasts where found by the magician deep down in a dungeon in the world of equations. He was a physicist when he decided to leave this realm to learn the language of motion and beauty. He knew the story of those dancers that learned how to speak that language with their bodies, they charmed the inquisitor eye, so they came back to this world and became artists. The inquisitor eye is the supreme order in the world of equations, it has a daughter, the princess of all shapes. That beautiful girl ruled that world for ages and she will to the end of eternity. The princess was waiting to meet the one to free her kind and it happened. Impossible to the physicist to resist, he fell in love with her. She instructed him and he learned the refined language of motion and beauty, but in exchange he had to take her kind and make them reborn in our world, so he will pass back along with them and became an Artist".</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"It is how this 'magician' came back to this realm and became an Artist". - I've repeated to myself, I had to find him and meet the sons of the beautiful princess from the world of equations! How many times we have the change to meet the royalty? So I didn't hesitate and asked to the tall people: where can I find them? They told me that he lives together with his sons at the <a title="Electriciteitsfabriek" href="http://electriciteitsfabriek.nl/" target="_blank">Electriciteitsfabriek</a>, so then I went. I've entered in a huge building full of hidden places, welcomed by a huge gallery where the newborn was standing.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The sons of the princess of shapes were there, standing still waiting in those galleries. I was there with all those curious spectators, wondering if they were alive. Like them, I was wishing for the fable to become true. I climbed to the second floor and found a bunch of lifeless body parts, lying in tables to show how the sons were born, like a sort of translation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was trying to think about their power source, like it was told trough the images the people was staring at, where I saw the beasts alive for the very first time. I was amazed how they were obeying their father.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I came back to the first floor and found a door, an imaginary one. I did read in the fable that there was a single way to travel to different realms. Imagination is for sure a difficult art to master, but there are individuals that traveled and came back from their long journeys with wisdom to be shared, the "magicians". Of course that the only thing that I could do is to follow their steps. Standing in that projected beach I felt that the living thought of the sons being brought to life was coming trough my mind and I saw them moving towards me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Through his exhibits Theo Jansen is been sharing his dream and bringing to life his sons as he promised to the beautiful princess, her kind was reborn here with the north sea's cold breeze, so then the fable has a happy end. I wanted to hear the whole story from its hero but his presentation was in Dutch, shame on me that I don't speak Dutch, but there are <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/theo_jansen_creates_new_creatures">Theo Jansen's TED talk</a>s that explains the whole story. Go a head and discover his work.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Every year after the exhibit is clotured, there's a parade that celebrates the birth of the princess sons the "strandbeest" and also celebrates the triumph of one of the last modern explorers a crazy admirable Dutch man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>For those that reached the end of this article I would like to share the following how it would fit in the fable, the fact that besides wind the stranbeest can be pushed/pulled? It is up to your imagination to make it fit in!</em></p>
