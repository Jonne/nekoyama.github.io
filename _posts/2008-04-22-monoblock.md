I've been thinking about my photo shooting session for the Monoblock's album cover.

I quit modeling when I was 16 years old and lately I've been looking for interesting modeling jobs. Two months ago I got a call from a friend, asking me to work for a local rock band. You've got to hear these guy's music, I like their "Extraños otra vez" song, I want to play it the entire photo session! <!--more-->

7:45PM I was driving back to home. I cried and couldn't stop it. I wanted a drink! The voice of Humphrey Bogart and all the nostalgia, oh Good. Will l remember that feeling for the photo shooting session? It's a MUST.

What do you think about wearing black boots, a black dress and drinking red wine..? This idea goes with the song?

Maybe I will be able to post 2 or 3 photos in low quality, please let me know what you think about them I will appreciate it. :D
