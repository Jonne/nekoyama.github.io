<p class="MsoNormal">I met this guy in Christmas time. 01/01/ 2009 we were in the middle of nowhere in the south of France with our friends, he was playing his guitar and singing. He’s the brother of a very good friend that I met here in Rennes. He lived in NY City for a while in order to play, learn and improve his music, now he lives in Canada with his girlfriend. I wish him the best.</p>
